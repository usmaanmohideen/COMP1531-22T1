'''
Write a python program vowel.py that

takes in a series of words on a single line in from STDIN,

passes that input string into a function called find_vowels,

which then returns the frequency of how often each vowel appears.

This object is then outputted (however you think works best).

Assume all input is lowercase or uppercase letters, or spaces.

If there are any uppercase letters
passed in as part of the input,
a ValueError should be thrown

and caught in the main part of the code.
The user should then be given a clear error

First, write a failing unit test that asserts the error is thrown
Then modify your code so that the test passes
Then, update the if __name__ block to catch the exceptional case.
