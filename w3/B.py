Group Activity
Your tutor will break you up into groups,
with people who you are not in the same project team as you.

You will have around 10 minutes to share:

    When you are running standups and whether they are synchronous or asynchronous
    How often you meet, how you meet, and what the goals/outcomes of any meetings so far have been
    Have they or will you try pair programming
    Any challenges you've faced already after being in a group

After that time, share thoughts among the class.
